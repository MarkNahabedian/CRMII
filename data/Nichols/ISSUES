Issues identified during my cleanup of "Item Nbr and summary note
2022-09-18.csv" that might require examination of the described items
to resolve.

86-21-218 refers to 86-21-17.  I dont know how to resolve that reference."

86-21-281 refers to a "page 259", presumably of the photo album
descrbed by 86-21-273.  I doubt the album has that many pages.  Other
items in the range 86-21-274-280 refer to pahe bumbers in the 50s.
