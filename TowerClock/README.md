# Timing of the Tower Clock

We were wondering if the ticking of the tower clock at the Charles
River Museum of Industry and Innovation was regular.

The ticking of the clock was recorded using the Arduino Science
Journal app on an android phone.

The data is analyzed in this
[Pluto notebook](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.12/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252FMarkNahabedian%252FCRMII%252Fmain%252FTowerClock%252Ftower_clock_notebook.jl).

Note that it could take several minutes for the nodebook to come up
and finish computing and displaying.
